# Task Three

Author a React component in multiple ES6 modules using JSX syntax.

Output a single linted, uglified ES5 file that expects `React` as a global and exposes its own global.

Also output linted, ES5 module files that can be consumed via CommonJS.

Use `webpack-dev-server` for development.
